# File and Folder Naming Guide

To make the source code less obvious and harder to casually browse, we use non-descriptive file and folder names.

| File Name          | Purpose                |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| `ZO1.php`          | Chat                   |
| `Z03.php`          | Index ( XXX Page)      |
| `AO1.php`          | Terms of Service       |
| `AO7.php`          | Privacy Policy         |
| `ZO1Z0AAO501N.php` | Config / Configuration |
| `AO10.php`         | User Profile           |
| `AO11.php`         | Create Post            |

| Folder Name        | Purpose                |
|--------------------|------------------------|

> Confusing, right? That's the point!  
> Feel free to rename files/folders to suit your needs.
