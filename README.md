## About Melo

Melo is a social networking site built as a side project by a small group of students.

The platform was created to serve as a social network specifically for students in schools — a space where they can connect, interact, and engage with their peers.

The project is open source — feel free to use it for any purpose. Contributions are always appreciated and help the project grow.

__Note__: Melo is not yet publicly available and remains in closed beta testing.
